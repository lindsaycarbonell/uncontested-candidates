  <h2>What does it mean for a seat to be uncontested?</h2>
    <p>The preceding graph shows the uncontested Democrat and Republican seats in the N.C. Senate for every general election since 2006. Due to gerrymandering, the practice of redistricting to give one party an advantage over another, uncontested seats have been commonplace for every general election. Because the party makeup of each district when gerrymandered is so skewed, those candidates are virtually impossible to defeat. Thus, they run unopposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is still unclear what the direct effect is of the number of uncontested seats in each election on policy-making, but one matter is clear: without a contest in a given district, voters are deprived of their power to make a choice about who represents them in state government.
